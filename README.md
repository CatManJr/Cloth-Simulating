# Cloth-Simulating
This is a Cpp cloth simulation inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjPBtxIupQA
Based on the app in the tutorial, I implemented the Verlet integration, and new features like drag tearing, damping and extra bounding conditions.
Note that the app only depend on SFML.
Here is a demo animation for you to show the effect of my code.
